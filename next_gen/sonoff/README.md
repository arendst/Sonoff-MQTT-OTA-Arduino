## Sonoff-MQTT-OTA-Arduino - TASMOTA NextGen

Current version is **3.2.6a** - See ```_releasenotes.ino``` for change information.

- This version provides all modules in one file starting with Sonoff Basic.
- Once uploaded select desired (Sonoff) module using the configuration webpage or the commands ```Modules``` and ```Module```
- After reboot select config menu again and change desired GPIO with optional sensor or use commands ```GPIOs``` and ```GPIO```.

This is the way I would like to go forward.

I plan to provide a smaller OTA uploader image if this production image becomes too large to be used with OTA.
